# Forms

The Symfony Form component has a powerfull extension system, and allows us to customize it with extra behaviors.

All this stuff is non-intrusive in your project and have to be activated through bundle config, and a form option.

## JSON extension

By default, Form component can handle HttpKernel request, but only if data are sent in `GET`, or in `POST` (`PUT` / `PATCH`) with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data` encoded data.

No Json. With current microservices / REST / cloud mania. Mmmmkay !

Json extension allows Form component to parse directly json into request content, and uses it like row data.

Step 1 : [Install](installation.md) the bundle.

Step 2 : Enable Json extension into your config.yml file
```yml
# app/config/config.yml

majora_framework_extra:
    # ...
    json_form_extension:
        enabled: true
```

Step 3 : Use dedicated option into your form
```php
public function postArticleAction(Request $request)
{
    $form = $this->container->get('form.factory')
        ->createNamed('', ArticleCreationType::class, null, array(
            'method' => 'POST',
            'csrf_protection' => false,
            'json_format' => true
        ))
    );

    $form->handleRequest($request);
    if ($form->isValid()) {
        // ......
    }
}
```

Step 4 : Test it !
```
POST /articles

Content-Type application/json;charset=UTF-8
# ....


{"title":"MajoraFrameworkExtraBundle documentation released","headline":"More than a year after release, MajoraFramework got a proper documentation !":"body":"That\'s amazing, everyone wanted a documentation of this tools package, and now this is done. All the team worked very hard to reach this goal, and i would personally thanks my mom who learned me to always push myself off limits !"}
```

Form component will validate and map all this json data as if they were sent in x-www-form-urlencoded.
